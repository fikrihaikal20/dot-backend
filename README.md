# MVC (Model - View - Controller)
MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is widely used in web development because it separates application logic from presentation. This separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable and scalable. In the MVC pattern, the Model represents data and business logic, the View is responsible for rendering the data, and the Controller handles user input and manipulates the data by interacting with the Model.

## Why i use MVC?
- Code organization: The pattern encourages modularization and separation of concerns, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.
- Code reusability: Since the application logic is separated from the presentation, the components can be reused in other parts of the application or even in other applications.
- Testability: The separation of concerns makes it easier to write unit tests for each component, ensuring that the application works as expected.
- Scalability: The pattern allows for the application to be easily scaled by adding new components or modifying existing ones without affecting the others.
